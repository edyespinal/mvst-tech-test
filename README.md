## MVST Challenge

Hi, thanks for applying to MVST, the next step of the process is a coding challenge. If you have anything that we can help you with, just ping us.


## How to get started 
  To get started with the challenge, first read the rest of this readme. Then you can go on and 
  read the README.md inside the frontend and backend folders.
  
  [Backend README](https://github.com/mvst-h/mvst-coffee-tea-challenge/blob/master/backend/README.md)
  
  [Frontend README](https://github.com/mvst-h/mvst-coffee-tea-challenge/blob/master/frontend/README.md)


## Introduction 

This challenge is a project that already contains backend and frontend structure. 

The backend and frontend are not connected at the beginning of the challenge. 

Your task will be to implement some requirements using this repository, but you may own the code. So feel free to refactor, readjust and improve if you feel like it. Also feel free to host the code, update the readme. 

## Task 

After running the frontend. You will see a list of coffees at "localhost:4000/coffees".

### Task 1 - Coffee list :coffee:
1. This list is currently static on the frontend. The first task is to connect the backend and the frontend to properly render the list with the data coming from the backend.

2. Update both the frontend and the backend to reflect the design in the following file Figma.

### Task 2 - Tea list :tea:

1. After part 1 is finished, we need to implement the second list. A list of teas. We need to add the backend and frontend to reflect the similar data in the design.

### Finishing the task
1. Create a Pull Request with the coding challenge.
2. Tell MVST HR Team that you are done with it
3. That is it :)

### Expected result

1. The challenge is completed if both lists are rendering on the frontend and fetching on the backend.
2. Using nest.js is a mandatory thing from this project.
3. Next.js is there to help you have a quick start and focus on the coding. You can replace to Create React App if you feel like it would be faster.

### What we will check
   To be transparent this are some things we consider important in the challenge
  
  1. General skills of programming, we will analise your code not only to have the lists rendering from the backend, but also the code quality in other ways.
  2. Outcome in comparison with the design


### ⚠️ Important notes
The current code is just a base project that you can easily start focusing on coding. Please take in consideration that the decisions of folder structure, backend layers and architecture and other decisions has to be yours. 

### FAQ

-  I am not familiar with nest.js and next.js
Don't spend much time trying to make a good project for nest and next, that is not what we want to analise in those challenges. They are just there so you have a running project and can show us some code.

For the frontend focus more in the react part then in the next.js part. 
For the backend part, focus more in the layers you add in the code than in really specifics for nest.js

- I don't want to use tailwind
Feel free to use pure css ( we love it ).
Feel free to use any other library that might help you
